## About:

**Datasets and models** related to the experiments on combining textual and visual features for newspaper article segmentation.

More precisely:

- **annotations**: contains image annotations, with one file per newspaper containing region annotations (label and coordinates) in [VIA](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/via/) format. Depending on the newspaper, those annotations are under license [CC0 1.0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) or [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). Please refer to the rights statements in each file.
- **images**: contains image files of the Swiss titles (GDL, IMP, JDG). Those images are under copyright but can be used for research purposes (redistribution, publication or commercial use are ***not*** permitted). Images of the Luxembourgish title are available through the IIIF endpoint of the National Library of Luxembourg.  Please refer to the rights statements and information in each file.
- **trained-models**: contains some of the best models, as described in the corresponding paper. Available under a [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license.
